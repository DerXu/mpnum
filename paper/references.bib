	abstract = {This survey provides an overview of higher-order tensor decompositions, their applications, and available software. A tensor is a multidimensional or N-way array. Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., N-way arrays with \$N {\textbackslash}geq 3\$) have applications in psycho-metrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere. Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: {CANDECOMP}/{PARAFAC} ({CP}) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including {INDSCAL}, {PARAFAC}2, {CANDELINC}, {DEDICOM}, and {PARATUCK}2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors.},

	abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method ({DMRG}) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that {DMRG} operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states ({MPS}), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the {DMRG} method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current {DMRG} thinking in the {MPS} language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of {DMRG} algorithms in exclusively {MPS} terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while {DMRG} is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

	abstract = {A simple nonrecursive form of the tensor decomposition in d dimensions is presented. It does not inherently suffer from the curse of dimensionality, it has asymptotically the same number of parameters as the canonical decomposition, but it is stable and its computation is based on low-rank approximation of auxiliary unfolding matrices. The new form gives a clear and convenient way to implement all basic operations efficiently. A fast rounding procedure is presented, as well as basic linear algebra operations. Examples showing the benefits of the decomposition are given, and the efficiency is demonstrated by the computation of the smallest eigenvalue of a 19-dimensional operator.},

	abstract = {The curse of dimensionality associated with the Hilbert space of spin systems provides a significant obstruction to the study of condensed matter systems. Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this difficulty in both the numerical and analytic regimes. These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states. The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.},

We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States ({MPS}) and Projected Entangled Pair States ({PEPS}). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1 d and 2 d quantum lattice systems are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We study a construction that yields a class of translation invariant states on quantum spin chains, characterized by the property that the correlations across any bond can be modeled on a finite-dimensional vector space. These states can be considered as generalized valence bond states, and they are dense in the set of all translation invariant states. We develop a complete theory of the ergodic decomposition of such states, including the decomposition into periodic “Néel ordered” states. The ergodic components have exponential decay of correlations. All states considered can be obtained as “local functions” of states of a special kind, so-called “purely generated states,” which are shown to be ground states for suitably chosen finite range {VBS} interactions. We show that all these generalized {VBS} models have a spectral gap. Our theory does not require symmetry of the state with respect to a local gauge group. In particular we illustrate our results with a one-parameter family of examples which are not isotropic except for one special case. This isotropic model coincides with the one-dimensional antiferromagnet, recently studied by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki.},
